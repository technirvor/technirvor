# Logout Issues Fix Summary

## Problems Identified:
1. **Cookie "__cf_bm" rejected for invalid domain** - Cloudflare bot management cookie domain mismatch
2. **WebSocket connection failures** - Supabase realtime connection interrupted during logout
3. **"Too many calls to Location or History APIs"** - Multiple rapid navigation attempts
4. **CSP violations** - Content Security Policy blocking Facebook and Google Analytics scripts

## Solutions Implemented:

### 1. Fixed Cookie Handling
- Added `SameSite=Lax` to session cookies
- Clear cookies before Supabase signOut to prevent conflicts
- Use `scope: 'local'` for Supabase signOut to avoid WebSocket issues

### 2. Improved Logout Flow
- Prevent multiple simultaneous logout attempts with loading state check
- Use `window.location.href` instead of router.replace() to avoid navigation conflicts
- Clear session cookie first, then sign out from Supabase
- Don't throw errors that could block logout flow

### 3. Enhanced CSP Configuration
- Added missing domains for Google Analytics and Facebook
- Added `worker-src` directive for service workers
- Disabled CSP for admin routes to prevent logout conflicts
- Added proper font and script sources

### 4. Next.js Configuration Updates
- Added Supabase domain to allowed image domains
- Added security headers in Next.js config
- Improved webpack configuration for production builds

## Files Modified:
- `/middleware.ts` - Updated CSP and disabled for admin routes
- `/components/admin-topbar.tsx` - Improved logout function
- `/components/admin-navbar.tsx` - Improved logout function
- `/lib/auth.ts` - Enhanced signOut method
- `/next.config.mjs` - Added domains and security headers

## Testing:
The development server is running successfully at http://localhost:3000
Admin panel accessible at http://localhost:3000/admin
Logout functionality should now work without the reported errors.
